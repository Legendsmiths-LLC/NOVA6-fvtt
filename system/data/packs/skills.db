For example, you might use Wits to decipher an ancient language on a tomb wall, know the atomic weight of antimony, spot a hidden passage or deduce that a murder victim was recently divorced based on subtle clues.

Instead, use Wits rolls when success or failure would result in something interesting.</p><div><h1>Create Advantage</h1></div><p>You can use Wits to create advantages that represent planning, know-how, insight. For example, you might use Wits to jury-rig or sabotage a device, research a creature’s weakness, or conceal your position with camouflage.
